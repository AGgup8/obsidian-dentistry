## Dental Relevance
If the patient requires a dental procedure with a low risk of bleeding complications, treat without interrupting their anticoagulant medication.

If a patient requires a dental procedure with a higher risk of bleeding complications, advise them to miss their apixaban or  dabigatran morning dose, or delay their rivaroxaban morning dose on the day of their dental treatment.

Explain risks and benefits of performing any dental treatment in patients on NOACs whether therapy is/is not continued.

Prefer appointments in the morning and early in the week.

Bleeding should be managed with [[Local Haemostatic Measures]].

Avoid concomitant use of drugs that may interfere with peak plasma concentrations of NOACs (e.g. NSAIDs for pain control).

Consider delay of invasive dental procedures for patients on time limited course of therapy, or in patients at the start of therapy (where initial doses may be higher).

Severe postoperative bleeding managed with application of mechanical pressure, haemostatic measures, and maintenance of intravascular volume with fluid replacement (and consideration of haemodialysis in emergency situations).
