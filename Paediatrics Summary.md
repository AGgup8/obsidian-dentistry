## [[Paediatric Periodontal Disease|Periodontal Disease]]
Paediatric periodontal disease is relatively rare. Unlike adult periodontal disease, which is often associated with poor oral hygiene, paediatric periodontal disease is caused by a combination of factors, including genetic predisposition, systemic disease, poor oral hygiene or orthodontic appliances.

## Soft Tissue Disease
Paediatric patients generally have the same soft tissue disease as adults. Some common paediatric oral soft tissue diseases include congenital and developmental lesions, traumatic and recurrent aphthous ulceration, mucoceles, and viral and candida infections.

## [[Molar Incisor Hypomineralisation]]
Molar incisor hypomineralisation (MIH) is a common developmental enamel defect that typically affects the first permanent molars and incisors. You need to learn the aetiology, clinical features, differential diagnoses and treatments from the [BDJ molar incisor hypomineralisation overview](https://www.nature.com/articles/sj.bdj.2018.814).

## [[Dental Trauma]]

You need to know the incidence, aetiology, potential complications and management for supernumeraries, and impacted and ectopic teeth. Learn the guidelines from the [Royal College of Surgeons of England](https://www.rcseng.ac.uk/dental-faculties/fds/publications-guidelines/clinical-guidelines/).
