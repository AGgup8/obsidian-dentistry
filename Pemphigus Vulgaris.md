# Pemphigus Vulgaris
Pemphigus vulgaris is an autoimmune skin condition resulting in non-pruritic intra-epidermal bullae.

## Demographic
40-60 years old

## Risk Factors
* Genetics
* Drugs: penicillamine, captopril

## Clinical Features
Pemphigus vulgaris commonly presents in the mouth (90%), and sometimes only presents in the mouth, commonly on the palate, buccal mucosa and gingivae.

* **fragile, short-lived bullae** that erupt into erosions
* **large, shallow, non-healing ulcers**

## Pathophysiology
Production of IgG autoantibodies to **superficial desmoglein-1 and -3**. The bullae are fragile because the autoantibodies target the superficial skin layer.

## Diagnosis
* Histopathology
* Immunofluorescence: intra-epidermal deposition of IgG and C3 that target desmosomes of basal and suprabasal keratinocytes
