# Hepatic Disease
Hepatic disease can cause problems with production of fibrinogen and clotting factors (II, V, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, XIII) and drug metabolism

## Clotting dysfunction
The diagnosis and severity of clotting dysfunction should be confirmed by arranging for a coagulation screen prior to treatment and especially before surgery.

Patients may need vitamin K or fresh frozen plasma to correct coagulation so the patient should be managed in hospital.

## Drugs
Drugs should be prescribed with care and avoided completely in severe hepatic disease, including paracetamol, NSAIDs and sedatives. It is difficult to predict the impairment of drug metabolism even when using lover function tests. Any drug prescribing should include reference to a drug formulary.
