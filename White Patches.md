# Normal anatomy
Fordyce spots - visible sebaceous glands, common, benign, creamy-yellow papules on the buccal/labial mucosa that may coalesce, reassure patient
Leucoedema - bilateral, diffuse, translucent, greyish appearance that disappears when spreading the affected mucosa

# Developmental
White sponge naevus

# Traumatic
Frictional keratosis
Cheek biting, trauma from dentures, cusps, fillings, orthodontic appliances

# Chemical
Aspirin burns
Smokers keratosis

# Autoimmune
Lichen planus
Lupus erythematous

# Infective
Chronic hyperplastic candidiasis
Oral hairy leukoplakia - associated with EBV and AIDS


## Leukoplakia - premalignant 4%

Homogenous - uniform flat appearance that may exhibit shallow cracks and has a smooth, wrinkled or corrugated surface with a consistent texture throughout

Non-homogenous - predominantly white or white and red lesion, irregularly flat, nodular and exophytic. Nodular lesions have raised, rounded, red and/or white excrescences. Exophytic lesions have irregular blunt or sharp projections

90% associated with the use of tobacco/betel nut and 10% idiopathic, M > F, buccal mucosa, mandibular gingiva, tongue, floor of mouth

Malignancy: increased risk if raised or nodular, red/white speckled, site: floor of mouth, lateral border of tongue, retromolar region, buccal sulcus (in betel nut chewers), labial commissure, advanced age, female




Erythroplakia - high risk lesion, always associated with dysplasia or carcinoma
Syphilis
Lichen planus
Chronic hyperplastic candidiasis
Betel nut chewing
