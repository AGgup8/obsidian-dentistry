# Radicular cysts
Radicular cysts are related to non-vital teeth and develop within a periapical granuloma. The most common site is the upper maxillary incisor and the peak age of incidence is 4-5th decade.

They are unilocular, well defined and well corticated with regular growth and limited buccal expansion. They are usually Continuous with the lamina dura of the root of affected tooth.

They do not usually cause resorption unless they are long standing, in which case they can cause resorption and displacement of adjacent teeth.

## Histology
* Thick wall of fibrous and granulation tissue
* Inflammatory cells
* Cholesterol clefts and Foreign-body giant cells in wall or lumen
* Non keratinised stratified squamous epithelial lining
* Mucous cells
* Hyaline bodies
* Lumen contents pale, pink, serous exudate, macrophages, desquamated epithelial cells, inflammatory cells and cholesterol clefts

## Treatment
Endodontic treatment or surgical extraction. Radicular cysts can form **residual cysts** if retained following extraction.
