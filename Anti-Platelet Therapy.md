Patients taking anti-platelet medication will have prolonged bleeding, but for minor surgery, it may not be clinically significant. For minor surgery, patients should be managed with [[Local Haemostatic Measures]]. The number of extractions at each visit visit should be limited to three. For major surgery, patients should be managed in a hospital setting and anti-platelet therapy may be stopped before surgery, in consultation with a cardiologist.
