# Bullous Pemphigoid
Bullous is a less severe condition compared to [[pemphigus vulgaris]].

Bullous pemphigoid is a chronic autoimmune skin condition with eruption of pruritic, tense, sub-epidermal bullae.

## Demographic
60-80 years old

## Clinical Features
Bullous pemphigoid presents as **pruritic, tense bullae** that primarily affects the skin, especially on the forearms, axillae and medial thighs that break down to form chronic, painful erosions. Mucous membrane involvement is seen in 10%-40% of patients.

Bullous pemphigoid is distinguished clinically from other blistering skin diseases by the following clinical features:
* Absence of atrophic scars
* Absence of head and neck involvement
* Relative absence of mucosal involvement

## Pathophysiology
Production of IgG autoantibodies against basement membrane antigens in **hemidesmosomes**. Hemidesmosomes attach cells of the epidermis to the extracellular matrix, and connect epithelial cells to the basement membrane.

The bullae are tense because the autoantibodies target the basement membrane, unlike [[pemphigus vulgaris]] which targets the superficial skin layer.

## Diagnosis
* Histopathology
* immunofluorescence: linear deposition of IgG and C3 at the basement membrane

## Treatment
Topical and systemic corticosteroids
