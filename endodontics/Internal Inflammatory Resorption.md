Internal inflammatory resorption is a pathological process characterised by resorption of the dentine and cementum of a tooth's root, caused by the invasion of inflammatory cells and enzymes into the pulp chamber and the root canal. Resorption starts from the inside of the tooth, adjacent to the pulp, and progresses outwards.
