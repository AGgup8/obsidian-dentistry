## Internal Inflammatory Resorption
Internal inflammatory resorption is a pathological process characterised by resorption of the dentine and cementum of a tooth's root, caused by the invasion of inflammatory cells and enzymes into the pulp chamber and the root canal. Resorption starts from the inside of the tooth, adjacent to the pulp, and progresses outwards.

## Internal Replacement Resorption
Internal replacement resorption is a pathological process where the dentine within the root canal is replaced by bone-like tissue.
