Plaque-induced gingivitis is an **inflammatory response of the gingival tissues** resulting from **bacterial plaque accumulation** located at and below the gingival margin. Plaque induced gingivitis is confined to the gingiva and is reversible by reducing levels of dental plaque.

It presents as swelling, redness, loss of stippling, and bleeding and discomfort on probing.
