It can be helpful to learn orthodontics by thinking of an orthodontic assessment.

## Medical History
* **Family History:** assess compliance, class III or class II division 2 have significant genetic inheritance
* **Previous Dental Treatment:** traumatic injuries to teeth or jaws (class II division 1), digit sucking habits, previous orthodontic treatment (compliance, root resorption, unfavourable growth)

## Extra-Oral: Skeletal and Soft Tissue

### Skeletal
* **Anterior-posterior:** Class I, Class II, Class III
* **Vertical:** Frankfort-Mandibular plane angle, Lower facial height
* **Transverse:** Mid-eyebrow - Tip of nose - Philtrum of upper lip - Chin point

### Soft Tissues
* **Lips:** morphology, competence, at function, overlap over incisors / incisor display at rest

## Intra-Oral: Intra-Arch and Inter-Arch

### Intra-Arch
* **Alignment:** rotations
* **[[Crowding]] and spacing:** mild, moderate, severe
* **Angulation**
* **Inclination:** proclined, normal, retroclined

## Diagnosis

### Malocclusions
Classify the skeletal, incisor and molar relationships. Skeletal relationships are associated with the same class incisor and molars relationship, e.g. a patient with a class II skeletal anterior-posterior relationship is more likely to have class II incisor and class II molar relationships.

The different classes are associated with different soft tissue and key dental features:
1. **Class I:** crowding, crossbite with or without displacement, open bite
2. **[[Class II Div 1 Malocclusion|Class II div 1]]:** [[crowding]], increased [[Overjet|overjet]], lip trap, reduced lip overlap
3. **[[Class II Div 2 Malocclusion|Class II div 2]]:** crowding, reduced overjet, increased or complete overbite
4. **[[Class III Malocclusion|Class III]]:** reduced overjet, anterior crossbite,

### Key Dental Features
Think of key dental features by using the Dental Health component of [[Index of Orthodontic Treatment Need (IOTN)|IOTN]]:
* **M**issing teeth
* **O**verbite
* **C**rossbite
* **D**isplacement
* **O: **[[Overjet]]
