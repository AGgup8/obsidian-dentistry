It can be helpful to learn orthodontics by thinking of an orthodontic assessment.

## Medical History
* **Family History:** assess compliance, class III or class II division 2 have significant genetic inheritance
* **Previous Dental Treatment:** traumatic injuries to teeth or jaws (class II division 1), digit sucking habits, previous orthodontic treatment (compliance, root resorption, unfavourable growth)

## Extra-Oral: Skeletal and Soft Tissue

### Skeletal
* **Anterior-posterior:** Class I, Class II, Class III
* **Vertical:** Frankfort-Mandibular plane angle, Lower facial height
* **Transverse:** Mid-eyebrow - Tip of nose - Philtrum of upper lip - Chin point

### Soft Tissues
* **Lips:** protrusion, competence, morphology, incisal show at rest (lip line)
* **Tongue:** size, posture, tongue thrust

## Intra-Oral: Intra-Arch and Inter-Arch

### Intra-Arch
* **Alignment:** rotations
* **[[Crowding]] and spacing:** mild, moderate, severe, generalised, localised, midline diastema
* **Angulation**
* **Inclination:** proclined, normal, retroclined

## Diagnosis

### Malocclusions
Classify the skeletal, incisor and molar relationships. Skeletal relationships are associated with the same class incisor and molars relationship, e.g. a patient with a class II skeletal anterior-posterior relationship is more likely to have class II incisor and class II molar relationships.

The different classes are associated with different soft tissue and key dental features:
1. **[[Class I Occlusion|Class I]]:** [[crowding]], crossbite with or without displacement, open bite
2. **[[Class II Div 1 Malocclusion|Class II div 1]]:** mandibular crowding, increased [[Overjet|overjet]], lip trap, reduced lip overlap
3. **[[Class II Div 2 Malocclusion|Class II div 2]]:** maxillary crowding, reduced overjet, increased or complete [[Overbite|overbite]]
4. **[[Class III Malocclusion|Class III]]:** maxillary crowding, anterior crossbite, reduced overjet

### Key Dental Features
Think of key dental features by using the Dental Health component of [[Index of Orthodontic Treatment Need (IOTN)|IOTN]]:
* **M**issing teeth
* **O:** [[Overbite]]
* **C**rossbite
* **D**isplacement
* **O:** [[Overjet]]

### "Normal" Malocclusions
**Ugly duckling stage:** A normal stage of dental development prior to the eruption of the maxillary canines. It is characterized by a midline space between the upper central incisors due to the eruption of the permanent canines. This stage is self-correcting and does not require treatment.

## Orthodontic Diagnostic Summary
1. **Patient:** name, age of patient and concern  
2. **Malocclusion:** skeletal, and incisor, canine and molar relationships  
3. **Key dental features:** ***m***issing teeth, ***o***verjet, ***c***rossbites, ***d***isplacement, ***o***verbite
