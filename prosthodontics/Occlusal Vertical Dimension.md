Occlusal vertical dimension (OVD) is the distance between the nose and chin when biting together.

**Excessive OVD can cause:**
* muscles of mastication fatigue
* discomfort
* patient is unable to wear dentures
* excessive display of mandibular teeth
* clicking of the posterior teeth when speaking
* strained appearance of the lips
* excessive trauma to supporting tissues
* gagging

**Insufficient OVD can cause:**
* ageing appearance of lower third of the face: thin lips, wrinkles, chin too near to nose, overlapping corners of mouth
* diminished occlusal force
* angular cheilitis

## How to calculate
Determine the [[Rest Vertical Dimension]] by moving the patient into centric relation and ask the patient to relax.

Substract 2-4mm to calculate occlusal vertical dimension.
