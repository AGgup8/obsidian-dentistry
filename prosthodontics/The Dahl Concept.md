The Dahl method works through a combination of intrusion (40%) of anterior teeth and extrusion (60%) of posterior teeth. It is commonly used to *increase interocclusal space* or to *increase occlusal vertical dimension* when restoring tooth surface loss.

1. **After placing the anterior restoration, it takes 1-2 weeks for patients to get used to the new bite. It is unusual to feel pain, but the bite may feel uncomfortable.**
2. **The posterior teeth will come back into contact over a period of 4-6 months, however, in some patients it can take up to a year.**
3. **In 1 out of 50 patients, the posterior teeth do not come back into contact. If this does not concern the patient, they do not need further treatment, but some patients may prefer posterior composite fillings to bring the teeth into contact.**

* The thickness of jaw registration material can be used to measure changes throughout treatment.

* Direct composite restorations are useful to first create initial space before placing definitive indirect restorations. Composite is inexpensive, simple to use, reversible, easy to adjust, and has favourable wear characteristics.

* Definitive restorations include: metal shims, metal-ceramic crowns, and removable metal or acrylic appliances. It may be more appropriate to use removable appliances when managing patients with unstable or stable periodontal disease.

* Current evidence suggests the Dahl technique does not increase the risk of TMJD, periodontal problems, or pulpal symptoms. But it can increase apical root resorption. The intrusion of teeth causes about four times more root resorption than extrusion.

* Cementing RBB restorations high does not increase the risk of abutment teeth proclining or the restoration debonding, suggesting that the Dahl technique can be used to make *modest* and *controlled* changes to the occlusion.
