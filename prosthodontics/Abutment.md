The abutment is the tooth to which the bridge attaches to. All teeth should be assessed before using them as abutments for bridges. Not all teeth should be used as abutments, and some have a better prognosis than others.  ^6e46e6

### Endodontically treated teeth
Endodontically treated teeth should be used as abutments because the removed dentine makes the tooth structure weaker.

### Crown-to-Root ratio / Periodontal status
The crown-to-root ratio can assess whether a tooth is a suitable abutment for a bridge.
It is the:
**[length of tooth above the bone : length of tooth below the bone]**

![[Crown-to-Root Ratio.png|300]]

**1:2** is the ideal ratio for an abutment tooth, which suggests the tooth is well-supported
**2:3** is a more realistic ratio 
**1:1** is the minimum ratio that should be as an abutment tooth
**2:1** suggests a poor bridge prognosis and the tooth should not be used as an abutment

### Ante's Law
The PDL surface area of the abutment teeth should be equal to or greater than the imaginary PDL surface area of the missing teeth.

### Root shape
Multiple, divergent, curved and broad roots are preferred over single, fused, conical and  round roots. **Think about which teeth are easiest to extract.**
