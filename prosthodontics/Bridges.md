## Types of bridges
| Type          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cantilever    | One abutment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Fixed-fixed   | Two abutments                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Fixed-movable | Rigid connector at distal end and movable connector that allows some vertical movement at the mesial end.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Hybrid        | Fixed-movable with the minimum preparation retainer carrying the movable connector; fixed-fixed with one conventional and one minimum-preparation retainer; a combination of a conventional retainer at one end and a resin-bonded retainer at the other end of the pontic. |

## Components

**[[Abutment]]:** ![[Abutment#^6e46e6]]

**[[Retainer]]:** ![[Retainer#^bf19d1]]

**[[Pontic]]:** ![[Pontic#^f4daff]]

**[[Connector]]:** ![[Connector#^f62047]]

## Design considerations
* Simple as possible
* Hygienic pontic design (ideally ovate)
* The [[Retainer]] should cover as much of the abutment tooth as possible with minimal thickness >0.7 mm
* Rigid [[Connector]]
* No contact on [[Pontic]] in excursion

## Contraindications
* Multi-surface, large restorations in the abutment teeth
* Lack of clinical crown height (connectors for porcelain-fused-metal bridges should have a **minimum height of 3Â mm**)
* Lack of periodontal bone support
* Significant bruxism
* Posterior extension
