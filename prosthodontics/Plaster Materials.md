### Type I - impression plaster
Type I stone is rarely used for dental impressions. It has been replaced by [[Impression Materials|hydrocolloids and elastomers]].

### Type II - plaster
Also known as **Plaster of Paris**. Dental plaster is the beta form of calcium sulphate hemihydrate. It is used to cast the **base** and **saddle areas**.

### Type III - stone
Denture stone / Yellow stone is the alpha form of calcium sulphate hemihydrate. Type III stone is preferred for casts to process **dentate areas** and **legs** because the stone has enough strength and detail.

### Type IV - high-strength or improved stone
Also known as **die stone**. Improved stone is formed from modified alpha hemihydrate. Type IV stone has the strength, hardness and minimal setting expansion needed for die material. It is only used to cast the secondary/master impression for Cobalt-Chromium dentures.

### Type V - high-strength, high expansion stone
Expensive and not commonly used in dentistry. Type V stone has higher compressive strength than type IV stone.
