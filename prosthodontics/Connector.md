The connector is the metal element that connects the wing/retainer to the pontic.  ^f62047

It is either rigid or non-rigid. The non-rigid design is only used when it is not possible to obtain a common path of insertion between abutments.

Connectors for porcelain fused to metal bridges are usually nickel-chromium, and should have a **minimum height of 3 mm** and a **minimum thickness of 0.7Â mm**.
