# Major connector
The major connector provides **rigidity** and unites all other components. It can be thought of as the chassis of a chair.

The major connector is placed on bounded tissues like the palate or the lingual aspect of the mandibular alveolar ridge.

**All major connectors should cross the midline at a right angle.**

## Maxillary connectors

### Complete palatal plate
The complete palatal plate is the **most rigid** design. It is used when all posterior teeth are missing bilaterally, teeth are periodontally compromised, shallow vault, small mouth, or flat or flabby ridges.

### Horseshoe
The horseshoe is the **least rigid** design. It is only used if there are large palatal tori.

## Mandibular connectors

### Lingual bar
The lingual bar is used when the depth of the lingual vestibule is **>7 mm**. It is the simplest and most common mandibular connector.

### Lingual plate
The lingual plate is used when the depth of the lingual vestibule is **<7 mm**, further tooth loss is anticipated, lingual tori, or all posterior teeth are missing bilaterally.

# Minor connector
The minor connector connects the major connector to rests, indirect retainers and clasps.
