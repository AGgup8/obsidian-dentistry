A **rest** is a rigid extension of a removable partial denture framework that contacts the occlusal, cingulum or incisal rest seats on an abutment tooth. The rest directs force through the long axis of the tooth to provide **[[Support|support]]** and prevents horizontal movement of the abutment tooth.

**Rest seats** are prepared into the occlusal, cingulum, or incisal surface of an abutment in order to receive and support a rest.
