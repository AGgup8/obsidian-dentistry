Support is resistance to vertical seating forces. It is tested by seating the denture in place, and pushing against the ridges. 

The **denture base** provides support by pressing against the soft and hard tissues in the mouth. For the upper arch, the **palate** and **alveolar ridge** provide the most support. For the lower arch, the **buccal shelf** and **retromolar pad** provide the most support.
