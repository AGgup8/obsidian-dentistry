Stability is resistance to **horizontal dislodging forces**. To test retention, apply pressure to one area of the denture's occlusal surface and observe if the denture **rocks or unseats**.  

The **denture flange** provides stability. For the upper and lower arches, the **ridge height** and **depth of the vestibule** create resistance to the horizontal dislodging forces.
