Rest vertical dimension (RVD) is the distance between the nose and chin when an individual is resting comfortably in an upright position. In this position, there is usually 3mm between the upper and lower premolars ([[Interocclusal Rest Distance]]).

## How to move the patient into rest vertical dimension
* Ask the patient to relax with their lips together without any further instructions. The distance between the two facial reference points may then be evaluated.

* Instruct the patient to lick their lips, swallow and relax. As the patient begins to relax, the reference points are evaluated.

* Ask the patient to make the “m” sound, keeping the lips together as they finish making the sound.
