### 1. Primary impression (1st appointment)
Take primary impression in a hydrocolloid material (alginate).

### 2. Primary cast and Special trays
For Cobalt-Chromium dentures, use **type III [[Plaster]] for the base** and **type IV plaster for dentate areas**.

Create a special tray from the primary cast using **cold-cure or light-cure acrylic**.

### 3. Secondary impression (2nd appointment)
Take secondary impression in **alginate or neo-colloid for partial dentures** or **mucoelastic materials (polyvinylsiloxane, polyethers/Impregum, zinc oxide) for complete dentures**.

When taking secondary impressions for partial dentures, edentulous areas have a large gap between the tray and alveolar ridge. The tray should be modified by placing **silicone putty** in the edentulous areas of the impression tray and placing it in the mouth to set. After settings, the putty can be carved down using a scalpel in order to **leave enough thickness for the impression material**. 

### 4. Master cast, Baseplate and Occlusal Rims
The denture baseplate is constructed on the master cast.

For partial dentures, the baseplate is constructed in **cold-cure acrylic**. Before making a cold-cure baseplate, the cast is **soaked in soapy water**, **surveyed** and **undercuts are blocked out with wax**. Wax Occlusal Rims are added to the cold-cure baseplate. The wax rims should only be as high as the adjacent teeth, so an interocclusal record (bite registration) can be taken.

For complete dentures, the baseplate is designed in **wax** on the cast, and it is sent to the lab so a **heat-cure acrylic base** can be constructed. It is important to mark the posterior palatal dam on the cast, so the upper denture has [[Retention]]. The lab will add occlusal rims to the heat-cure baseplate. Because the original cast is destroyed to make the heat-case base, make a **support cast** using the returned baseplate.

### 5. Jaw/Bite registration (3rd appointment)

* Midline
* Canines
* Smile line
* Interpupillary and mid tragus to mid alar lines parallel with occlusal plane - use foxe's occlusal plane

**Interocclusal Record and Facebow**
Take an interocclusal record and facebow jig record, so the opposing casts can be mounted accurately on the articulator. An interocclusal record is not needed if ICP is **stable and reproducible** outside the mouth.
