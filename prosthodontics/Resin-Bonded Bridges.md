A fixed partial denture that is luted to tooth structures, primarily enamel, which has been etched to provide micromechanical retention for the resin luting agent.

## Components
The retainer of a resin-bonded bridge is usually called a **wing**. It is usually made of nickel-chromium or cobalt-chromium alloys and sandblasted with 50 microns alumina.

The [[Connector]] of a resin-bonded bridge needs a **minimum height of 3 mm** and **minimum thickness of 0.7 mm** and at least a **180 degree wrap** around abutment teeth.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

| Advantages                            | Disadvantages |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Minimally invasive/Reversible         | Aesthetics    |
| Less demanding and less clinical time | Debonding     |
| Less expensive                        | Longevity     |
| Less catastrophic failure             |               |
| Predictable                           |               |

| Metal-framed               | Non-precious metal that is cemented with a chemically active resin cement       |
| Fibre-reinforced composite | Fibre-reinforced with glass, ultra-high molecular polyethylene or Kevlar fibres |
| All-ceramic                | Glass-infiltrated aluminium oxide ceramic or zirconia                           | 

## Cementation

1. Try-in for fit and aesthetics
2. Re-sandblast to remove contaminants and improve retention
3. Isolate teeth for moisture control
4. Etch and prime abutment
5. Mix and apply Panavia to retainer and tooth
6. Position bridge and remove excess cement
7. Apply Oxyguard and keep in place for 4 minutes

 Cementing the RBB restoration 'high' on the abutment tooth does not increase the risk of abutment teeth proclining or the restoration debonding. It has the advantages of reducing tooth preparation, maximising connector height, maximising occlusal coverage and avoiding contact on the pontic.

## Failure
* Pontic is involved in guidance during mandibular excursive movements.

* Parafunctional forces (nail/pen biting, bruxism). Habits should be identified, and the patient should be counselled to avoid them. For bruxism, An occlusal splint can be considered.
