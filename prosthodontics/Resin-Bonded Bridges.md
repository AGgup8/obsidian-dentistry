A fixed partial denture is luted to tooth structures, primarily enamel, which has been etched to provide micromechanical retention for the resin luting agent.

## Components
The retainer of a resin-bonded bridge is usually called a **wing**. It is usually made of nickel-chromium or cobalt-chromium alloys and sandblasted with 50 microns alumina.

The [[Connector|connector]] of a resin-bonded bridge needs a **minimum height of 3 mm** and **minimum thickness of 0.7 mm** and at least a **180-degree wrap** around abutment teeth.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

| Advantages                            | Disadvantages |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Minimally invasive/Reversible         | Aesthetics    |
| Less demanding and less clinical time | Debonding     |
| Less expensive                        | Longevity     |
| Less catastrophic failure             |               |
| Predictable                           |               |

## Materials
* **Metal:** Non-precious metal
* **Fibre-reinforced composite:** Fibre-reinforced with glass, ultra-high molecular polyethylene or Kevlar fibres
* **All-ceramic:** Glass-infiltrated aluminium oxide ceramic or Zirconia

## Case Selection
### Abutment Teeth
* **Periodontal health:** If the potential abutment tooth has active periodontal disease, using it as an abutment can increase the rate of periodontal destruction.
* **Sufficient tooth structure:** The abutment tooth needs sufficient sound enamel for bonding.
* **Alignment:** Crowding, rotations and titling can affect retainer surface area and wraparound, which decreases the bonding strength.
* **Translucency:** If the teeth, typically incisors, are noticeably translucent, the greyish discolouration from the metal retainer wing will be more noticeable.

### Occlusion
* **Adequate spacing:** The adjacent teeth or the opposing tooth may need to be adjusted for an aesthetic pontic.
* **Excursive movements:** Guidance on the pontic should be avoided, or shared with other teeth if it can't be avoided.
* **Parafunctional forces:** Bruxism and nail or pen biting can increase the risk of debonding.

## Design Considerations
### Retainer
* **Occlusal coverage:** 180-degree wraparound and occlusal coverage increase retainer surface area and therefore bond strength.
* **Minimise flexion:** for a metal retainer, height >3 mm and thickness >0.7 mm.
* **Aesthetics:** Reduce greyish discolouration of the abutment tooth caused by a metal retainer by using an opaque cement and avoiding extension of the retainer to within 2mm of the incisal edge.

### Pontic
* **Type of pontic:** The ideal [[Pontic|pontic]] designs are modified lap ridge (most common), ovate or hygienic.
* **Consider replacing soft tissue:** Consider using pink porcelain to replace the gingival tissues. However, matching gingival shade and texture is difficult.

## Cementation
1. Try-in for fit and aesthetics
2. Re-sandblast to remove contaminants and improve retention
3. Isolate teeth for moisture control
4. Etch and prime abutment
5. Mix and apply Panavia to the retainer and tooth
6. Position the bridge and remove excess cement
7. Apply Oxyguard and keep in place for 4 minutes

 **Cementing the bridge 'high' on the abutment tooth does not increase the risk of abutment teeth proclining or the restoration debonding.** It has the advantages of reducing tooth preparation, maximising connector height, maximising occlusal coverage and avoiding contact on the pontic.

## Failure
**The most common reason for failure is debonding.** 

The risk of bonding is increased if:
* Pontic is involved in guidance during mandibular excursive movements.
* Parafunctional forces (nail/pen biting, bruxism). Habits should be identified, and the patient should be counselled to avoid them. For bruxism, An occlusal splint can be considered.

Other reasons include damage or a change in the shade of the porcelain or surrounding natural teeth.
