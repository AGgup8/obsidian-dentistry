## Effect of light source

**Metamerism**
Colours appear different under different lighting. 5500K and 100% CRI is ideal lighting.

**Fluorescence**
Objects emit visible light when exposed to ultraviolet light.

**Opalescence**
Light effect of a translucent material appearing blue in reflected light and red-orange in transmitted light. Teeth have slight opalescence due to hydroxyapatite crystals.

**Translucency**
The degree that light is permitted to pass through an object rather than be absorbed or reflected. It depends on the thickness of enamel and dentine.

## Effect of background

**Value contrast effect**
The relative lightness of an object is affected by the lightness of the contrasting background or surrounding.

**Hue contrast effect**
When viewed against different background colours, the teeth appear to take on the hue of the backgroundâ€™s complementary colour.

## Tips

* Select shade prior to tooth preparation and early on the appointment - reduces eye fatigue, tooth dehydration under rubber dam and change of tooth colour during preparation
* First choose the value, then the dominant chroma, and finally hue
* By squinting the eyes, make rapid comparisons with shade tags (no more than 5 sec) and gaze at blue colour between attempts
* When in doubt, pick a shade with a higher value or less chroma. When can always add more colour and make something darker, but you can't make something lighter.
