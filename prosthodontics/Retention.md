Retention is the resistance to vertical **dislodging** forces, in contrast to [[Support]] which is resistance to vertical **seating** forces.

The peripheral seal provides retention. The peripheral seal is formed by surface tension, which is a combination of [[Adhesion]] between the oral tissues, saliva and denture base, and [[Cohesion]] of saliva.

Inadequate retention can be caused under-extension (denture flange is too short) because the surface area for surface tension is reduced, and the meniscus of surface tension is less protected by the buccal sulcus.
