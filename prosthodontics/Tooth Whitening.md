*Any treatment, procedure or method a dental professional might prescribe to whiten the colour and brighten your teeth.*

##  Indications
* Generalised staining
* Ageing
* Extrinsic staining (tetracycline staining)
* Fluorosis
* Traumatic pulpal changes
* White and brown spots

## Contraindications
* Unrealistic expectations (can only whiten a few shades lighter)
* Decay or peri-apical pathology
* Pregnancy and breastfeeding
* Hypersensitivity, cracked, exposed dentine
* Existing crowns, large restorations, if the patient can't afford to change existing restoration post bleaching
* Recession and yellow roots (roots don't bleach as readily as crowns)

## Techniques

### Vital bleaching
**Home use:** 10% (up to 18%) carbamide peroxide in a dental tray, 2-6 weeks to achieve result
**Office bleaching:** 30% carbamide peroxide carried out in a single visit + additional 10% home use

10% carbamide peroxide releases about 3% hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide breaks down very rapidly and releases oxygen free radicals. The free radicals bleak pigment bonds.
The oxygen molecules then attach to the double carbon bonds and break them into single carbon bonds. Single carbon bonds reflect light and the molecules are not translucent.
Because the molecules are smaller, they can diffuse through the tooth and absorb less light.

### Non-vital bleaching (walking bleaching)
**"Inside/Outside"** method using 10% carbamide peroxide sealed within the canal. Non-vital bleaching can cause external resorption, especially if heated and the tooth is associated with trauma or orthodontic treatment.

## Post-op Instructions
1. Avoid substances which may stain teeth: red wine, coca cola, coffee, tea.
2. Teeth can be sensitive for 24â€“48 hours. 55-75% of patients experience sensitivity.
