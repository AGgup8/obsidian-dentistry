A cyst is a pathological cavity containing fluid, semi-fluid or gas, **but not pus**. It is frequently linked with the epithelium. *(Cysts of the Jaws & Oral Regions I & II, 2022-2023)*

‘A closed, sac-like pocket of tissue that can form anywhere in the body. It may be filled with fluid, air, pus, or other material. Most cysts are benign (not cancer).’ *(Surgical management of Benign & Cystic Lesions, 2022-23)*

# Clinical Features
* swelling
* displaced or mobile teeth
* pain
* eggshell cracking
* fluctuant

# Pathogenesis
## 1. Sources of epithelium
Odontogenic cysts are lined with epithelium derived from:

The **epithelial cell rests of Malassez** lead to:
Radicular, residual, and glandular cysts

A split between the **reduced enamel epithelium** and enamel leads to:
Dentigerous (follicular and eruption) cysts

The **[[rests of Serres]]** lead to:
Keratocyst, lateral periodontal, gingival, and glandular cysts

## 2. Stimuli
* Inflammation
* Genetic defects in a tumour suppressor gene

## 3. Growth
**Internal hydraulic pressure**
Internal hydraulic pressure leads to expansion of inflammatory and dentigerous cysts.

Protein accumulation with the semipermeable cyst wall leads to fluid accumulation in the cyst lumen by osmosis. The fluid accumulation creates a positive pressure in the lumen. 

**Bone resorption**
Production of pro inflammatory cytokines IL-1(from macrophages), TNF and PGE2 (from fibroblasts) induce bone resorption.

Produced by cysts, stimulating bone resorption.

**Epithelial proliferation**
Growth factors such as epidermal growth factor EGF and transforming growth factor beta may cause pronounced proliferation of cyst epithelium.

# Radiographs
For small cysts, use an intra-oral periapical radiograph with another radiograph for paralleling.

For larger cysts, you can use an OPG with another radiograph for paralleling.

For complex cysts, a CBCT might be suitable.

| Radiographic feature                  | Indication                       |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Scalloped margins                     | Larger lesions, Keratocysts      |
| Loss of well defined margin           | Infection                        |
| Round                                 | Hydrostatic growth               |
| Non-round                             | Keratocyst or solitary bone cyst |
| True multilocular (multiple cavities) | Keratocyst                       |

# Management
**[[Enucleation]]** - to surgically remove intact from surrounding capsule. Successful treatment depends on the complete removal of the cyst lining, and uneventful healing of the oral wound without secondary infection of the underlying blood clot. Enucleation uses a Gentamycin sponge to try to prevent infected haematoma in the cyst cavity.

**Curettage** – scraping

**Marsupialisation** – forming a continuous surface from the exterior (mouth) into the interior of a cyst/abscess.
