# Warfarin
## Mechanism
Antagonist and inhibits vitamin K dependent synthesis of clotting factors (VII, IX, X and prothrombin II) affecting formation of fibrin clot.

Warfarin takes 36 hours or longer to peak anticoagulant effect, which is measured by prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT).

## Interactions
Metronidazole
Erythromycin
Amoxycillin
NSAIDS and aspirin

## Dental Relevance
Patients within the normal range may not require any change to their warfarin dose at all for minor surgery but should be warned that there is an increased risk of bleeding after surgery. An INR measurement should be carried out within 24 hours of surgery and preferably on the day of surgery. Local measures for homeostasis are likely to be suitable.

Patients who do bleed should follow [[Emergency Management of a Bleeding Patient]].
