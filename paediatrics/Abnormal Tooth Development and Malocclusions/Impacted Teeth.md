An impacted tooth is a tooth that has **failed to erupt** due to an identifiable obstruction / barrier to eruption of a normally positioned tooth.

The most likely to be impacted are: **third molars > maxillary canines > maxillary central incisors**.

## Aetiology
There are several factors that can contribute to the development of impacted teeth.

* **Lack of space:** The most common cause of impacted teeth is a lack of space in the jawbone. This can be due to genetics, abnormal growth patterns of the jaw, overcrowding of teeth, supernumerary teeth, or early loss of the primary teeth leading to loss of arch length.
* **Prolonged retention of the primary tooth:** retention of primary teeth due to [[Dental Ankylosis|ankylosis]] can cause impaction or eruption delay of the permanent tooth.
* **Abnormal tooth position:** Teeth that grow in an abnormal direction or angle can get blocked and fail to emerge properly.
* **Trauma:** Dental injury can cause dilceration or ankylosis
* **Localised pathology:** Supernumerary teeth, odontomes and cysts

## Complications
* [[Internal resorption]] of the impacted tooth
* [[External resorption]] of the impacted tooth, leading to ankylosis
* External resorption of adjacent teeth  
* Displacement of adjacent teeth and loss of arch length
* Dentigerous cyst formation
