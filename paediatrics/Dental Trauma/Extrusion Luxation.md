The tooth has been extruded/displaced partially out of the socket.

## Primary teeth
1. Take baseline periapical or occlusal baseline radiograph. There will be **increased periodontal ligament space apically**.
2. Do not position the tooth if there is <3 mm displacement, and it is not interfering with occlusion. Let the tooth spontaneously reposition itself. If there is >3 mm displacement, XLA.
3. Follow up at 1 wk, 6-8 wk and 1 yr.
4. Parents should be informed to watch for any unfavourable outcomes and return to the clinic if necessary.
	Unfavourable outcomes: symptomatic, pulp necrosis and infection, no further root development, no improvement in position, negative impact on the development or eruption of permanent successor.
