Avulsion is the complete displacement of the tooth out of the socket.

## Primary Teeth
1. Take baseline periapical or occlusal baseline radiographs. It is essential when the primary tooth is not brought into the clinic to **ensure that the missing tooth has not been intruded**. The radiograph will also provide a baseline for **assessment of the developing permanent tooth** and to determine whether it has been displaced.
2. **Avulsed primary teeth should not be replanted**. Reasons include a significant treatment burden (including replantation, splint placement and removal, and root canal treatment) for a young child and potential damage to the permanent tooth or its eruption. The most important reason not to replant is to avoid the risk of the child aspirating the tooth, which could lead to a medical emergency.
3. Follow up at 6-8 wk. **Further follow-up at 6 yr of age is indicated to monitor the eruption of the permanent tooth.**
4. Parents should be informed to watch for any unfavourable outcomes and return to the clinic if necessary. 

Unfavourable outcomes include a negative impact on the development or eruption of the permanent successor.

## Permanent Teeth
Prolonged extra-oral dry time and delayed reimplantation have a poor long-term prognosis because the periodontal ligament cells on the tooth become necrotic and cannot regenerate. if the PDL becomes necrotic, the expected outcome is [[External Resorption|replacement root resorption]].

However, **permanent teeth should always be reimplanted**, even with an extra-oral dry time of >60 minutes, to **restore aesthetics and function and increase future treatment options**. The tooth can be extracted later at a more appropriate time. Patients should be warned of the risk of [[Dental Ankylosis|ankylosis]] and infraocclusion.

As a result, the management is generally the same, regardless of the extra-oral dry time. 

### Permanent Teeth with Closed Apex
1. **If the tooth has already been reimplanted before arrival:** Leave the tooth in place. Wash the injured area with water, saline or chlorhexidine. Assess clinically and radiographically for correct positioning. Administer local anaesthetic, ideally without vasoconstrictor. If malpositioned, reposition the tooth using light digit pressure within 48 hours of the trauma.

Or,

1. **If the tooth has an extra-oral dry time of <60 minutes or >60 minutes:** the start of management is the same. Wash the tooth to remove contaminants and debris using saline or by agitating the tooth in the storage solution. Put or leave the tooth in a storage medium while taking a history, and examining the patient clinically and radiographically. Administer local anaesthetic, ideally without vasoconstrictor. Irrigate the socket with saline and examine for debris or fractures. If there is a fracture, reposition the fracture into its original position. Reimplant the tooth slowly using gentle digit pressure. After reimplantation, examine the tooth clinically and radiographically for correct positioning.

The next steps are the same whether the tooth was already implanted on arrival, the extra-oral dry is <60 minutes or the extra-oral dry time is >60 minutes.

2. Stabilize the tooth for 2 weeks using a passive, flexible wire.
3. Suture gingival lacerations, if present.
4. Initiate root canal treatment within 2 weeks after reimplantation.
5. Administer systemic antibiotics.
6. Check tetanus status.
7. Provide post-operative instructions.
8. Follow-up.

### Permanent Teeth With Open Apex

The management of a tooth with an open apex is the same as the management with a [[Avulsion#Permanent Teeth With Closed Apex|closed apex]]; however, root canal treatment is not always needed after reimplantation. The goal when replanting immature teeth is **pulp revascularization**, which can lead to **further root development**. **Endodontic treatment should not be initiated unless there are definite signs of pulp necrosis and infection.**

If spontaneous pulp revascularization does not occur, carry out endodontic treatment as soon as pulp necrosis or infection is identified because [[External Resorption|inflammatory external resortion]] can occur very rapidly in children.
