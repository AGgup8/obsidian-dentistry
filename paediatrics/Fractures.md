## Uncomplicated crown fractures (without pulp exposure)
* Enamel-only, Enamel-dentine or Crown-root.
* If the fragment is available it can be reattached using resin composite, otherwise the tooth should be restored using direct composite placement which is preferred over temporary glass ionomer bandage.

## Complicated crown fractures (with pulp exposure)
* If there is pulpal exposure, all attempts should be made to maintain tooth vitality by performing a **partial pulpotomy**.
* Under local anaesthesia and isolation:
	1. 2-3 mm of pulp tissue is removed through the exposure using a small round diamond bur.
	2. Using a cotton wool pledget soaked in sodium hypochlorite apply pressure to clean the area and stop the bleeding. If the pulp does not stop bleeding remove a further 1 mm and apply pressure until haemostasis is achieved. If haemostasis of pulp cannot be achieved, it indicates that the pulp is irreversibly inflamed, and a full pulp tissue removal or extirpation is required.
	3. Apply non-setting calcium hydroxide or MTA.
	4. Restore either reattaching the fragment, glass ionomer or composite.

## Root fractures
* Under local anaesthesia, the coronal fragment should be digitally repositioned then check the occlusion before splint placement.
* For apical and middle third fractures, four weeks of non-rigid splinting is needed but cervical third fractures require four months.
