Molar incisor hypomineralisation (MIH) is defined as '*hypomineralisation of systemic origin, presenting as demarcated, qualitative defects of the enamel of one to four first permanent molars (FPMs) frequently associated with affected incisors*'.

## Aetiology
MIH is thought to be caused by a **disturbance to amelogenesis during the third trimester of pregnancy or within the first three years of life** by systemic factors such as acute or chronic illness or exposure to environmental pollutants.

## Clinical features
Although MIH typically involves **one or more first permanent molars**, with or without incisor involvement, it is now thought that the lesions can affect any primary or permanent tooth. 

* **Hypomineralised and white, creamy, yellow or brown lesions**
* **Post-eruptive breakdown:** Leading to cuspal fracture in severe cases

MIH is also thought to be associated with hypomineralised second primary molars and lesions of the tips of permanent canines.

## Differential diagnosis
* ***Fluorosis:*** Fluorosis lesions have a bilateral symmetrical pattern, unlike MIH which has asymmetrical lesions.
* ***Amelogenesis imperfecta:*** Amelogenesis imperfecta affects **all teeth of both dentitions**and the patient usually has a **family history**.
* ***Enamel hypoplasia:*** The borders of enamel hypoplasia lesions are **smooth and regular**, whereas post-eruption MIH lesions are sharp and irregular.
* ***White spot lesion:*** White spot lesions are early enamel lesions. They have a more chalky, matt and opaque appearance compared to the adjacent sound enamel.
* ***Traumatic hypoplasia:*** Traumatic hypoplasia is associated with a **history of trauma to the primary predecessor tooth** (e.g. periapical infection). It has a very varied clinical presentation. It is usually limited to **one tooth** and asymmetrical.

## Treatment

### Prevention, hypersensitivity and remineralisation
* ***Fluoride toothpaste >1450 ppm***
* ***Professional fluoride varnish application***.
* ***Long-term use of CPP-ACP containing products:*** CPP-ACP improves remineralisation throughout the whole depth of MIH lesions, whilst fluoride tends to remineralise the surface layer.
* ***Fissure seal MIH molars:*** Resin-based fissure sealants are preferred when the surface of the enamel is intact. Glass ionomer cement is recommended when the tooth is **partially erupted**, **hypersensitive** or has **post-eruption breakdown**. *Unlike normal fissure sealants, MIH molars should be filled up to the cusp level rather than one-third of the cuspal incline.*

### Molars
* ***Resin infiltration:*** Thought to be more suitable for severe cases. It is not yet strongly recommended.
* ***Restorations:*** Resin composite is the recommended material. Glass ionomer cement should only be considered as intermediate restorations if moisture control can not be achieved.
* ***Full or partial coverage:*** Performed metal crowns (PMCs) are preferred
* ***Extraction:*** Extract before the eruption of the second permanent molars, the best time to extract mandibular first permanent molars is **during the calcification of the bifurcation of the second permanent molars (8-10 years old)**. 

### Incisors
* ***Microabrasion:*** Remove surface discolouration and brown mottling 
* ***Bleaching:*** Camouflage white lesions by increasing the overall brightness of the tooth
* ***Etch-Bleach-Seal:*** Remove yellow-brown staining
* ***Resin infiltration***
* ***Composite restorations/veneers:*** Large enamel defects with exposed dentine or chipped enamel
* ***Porcelain veneers:*** Only indicated for **patients aged 18+** when the gingival margin has matured
