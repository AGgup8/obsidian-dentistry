Dental trauma refers to any injury or damage to the teeth, gums, or surrounding tissues in the mouth. Dental trauma can result from a variety of causes, such as accidents, sports injuries, falls, or violence. Prompt and appropriate treatment is essential to minimize the long-term effects of dental trauma and restore oral health and function.

## Risk factors
The most common teeth affected by dental trauma are the **maxillary central incisors**.
* Male
* Ages 2-6
* Overjet >6 mm
* Low socioeconomic status

## Management

### 1. Take a detailed history and carry out a thorough clinical examination of the face, soft tissues and teeth
* Eliminate other injuries such as brain injury and facial fracture. **If there are signs of brain injury, consider referral to the local maxillofacial department.**
* Carry out general facial examination by gently palpating the facial structures such as the infraorbital rim, cheek bones, nose, maxilla and the lower border of the mandible. **Note any asymmetry, step deformities or tenderness.**
* It is important to also assess the occlusion and jaw movements as well.

### 2. Make a dental trauma diagnosis 
* Classify and diagnose the type of dental injury through clinical and radiographic examination.
* Two radiographic views are ideal: periapical and occlusal views. This is to establish whether it is a primary or permanent tooth and determine whether it is a luxation or fracture injury.

#### Further investigations
* **Sensibility testing:** Sensibility testing can be unreliable after trauma
* **Tooth colour:** Yellow, pink or grey discolouration
* **Tooth mobility:** Grade 1 to 3 mobility, ankylosis
* **Percussion sound:** Normal or dull
* **Tender to percussion:** +ve TTP might suggest periapical pathology
* **Radiographic:** Periapical radiolucency, closed or open apex

### 3. Carry out acute management

#### Types of Trauma
| Fractures                                                                   | Periodontal          | Oral Mucosa |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ----------- |
| Enamel infarction                                                           | [[Concussion]]       | Laceration  |
| Uncomplicated crown fracture (enamel-only fracture)                         | [[Subluxation]]      | Contusion   |
| Uncomplicated crown fracture (enamel-dentin fracture)                       | [[Intrusion]]        | Abrasion    |
| Complicated crown fracture (enamel-dentin fracture with pulp exposure)      | [[Lateral luxation]] |             |
| Uncomplicated crownroot fracture (crown-root fracture without pulp exposure | [[Extrusion]]        |             |
| Complicated crown-root fracture (crown-root fracture with pulp exposure)    | [[Avulsion]]         |             |
| Root fracture                                                               |                      |             |
| Alveolar fracture                                                           |                      |             |

#### Aftercare advice
* Soft diet for 2-4 weeks
* Maintain good oral hygiene: gently brush 2 x times daily as normal, rinse gently with chlorhexidine mouthwash 2-3 times daily for 14 days
* Take painkillers as and when required
* Finish the course of antibiotics if prescribed
* Avoid participation in contact sport
* Follow up tetanus status with your GP (if injury happened where there was soil)

### 4. Clinical follow-up and long-term management

## Sequelae

### Pulp
The survival of the pulp after trauma is influenced by the **severity of damage to the blood supply**, **area and time of exposure** and **stage of root development**.

The 5 sequelae for the pulp following trauma are: health, [[Pulp Canal Obliteration]], [[Internal Resorption|Internal Inflammatory Resorption]], [[Internal Resorption|Internal Replacement Resorption]], and [[Pulp Necrosis]].

### Periodontal
Periodontal tissues will undergo normal healing or [[External Resorption]].

### Gingival
Gingival tissues will undergo normal healing, or loss of attached gingivae.

### Root development
The root will follow continuous, disrupted or arrested growth.
