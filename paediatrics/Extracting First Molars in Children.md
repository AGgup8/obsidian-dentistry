## Compensating extractions
A compensating extraction is an extraction of the same tooth from the opposing quadrant in the opposing arch. For example, LR6 is planned for extraction, so a compensating extraction would be the removal of the UR6.

* When the extraction of a lower FPM is required, **the compensating extraction of a sound upper FPM should not be routinely carried out**.
* Unless there is a clear occlusal requirement or the upper FPM will be unopposed for a long time.

## Balancing extractions
A balancing extraction is the extraction of the same tooth from the opposite side of the same arch. For example, extraction of the LR6 is planned, so a balancing extraction would be the removal of the LL6.

* Routine balancing extraction of a sound FPM to preserve a dental centreline is not recommended unless part of a comprehensive [[Orthodontics Summary|orthodontic]] treatment plan.
* If there is **severe** bilateral premolar crowding, consideration should be given to balancing extractions of contralateral FPMs.

## Timings for extractions of first permanent molars
Extraction of FPMs should be followed by eruption of second permanent molars (SPMs) to replace them.

Ideal timing of FPM extraction can only be achieved if:
* **The SPM is unerupted:** If the SPM has erupted, it will not migrate mesially.
* **You have access to a recent DPT:** To assess SPM development and the presence of a third primary molar (TPM).
* **The FPM can be temporised and extraction can be delayed:** If there are symptoms such as pain, swelling or infection, the FPM can not be temporised and immediate extraction is requried.

### Upper arch
* An unerupted SPM will generally achieve a good occlusal position following extraction of the compromised FPM.
* If there is crowding in the upper arch or if space will be required for correction of a [[Class II Div 1 Malocclusion|Class II]] incisor relationship, consider temporising the FPM until the mandibular SPM erupts so the space can be used for orthodontic alignment. The lower SPM acts as an occlusal stop.

### Lower arch
* In the lower arch, the occlusal outcome is more variable and the timing of FPM extraction is more critical to ensure successful eruption of the SPM.
* Classically, the best age for extraction of FPMs is between 8-10 years before the eruption of the SPMs when there is radiographic evidence of bifurcation of the crowns of the SPMs.
* However, recent work suggests that whilst there may be a relationship between **age and root development**, **the angulation of the SPM** and **presence of the TPM** at the time of FPM extraction may be more important in predicting a good SPM occlusal position.
* If a TPM is present, it is expected that the child will have two erupted molars in each quadrant and FPM extraction is much more acceptable. The extraction of a FPM can also improve the position of the TPM.
