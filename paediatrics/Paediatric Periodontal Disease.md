## [[Plaque-Induced Gingivitis]]
Plaque-induced gingivitis is worsened in children because of mouth-breathing, crowded teeth, erupting teeth and orthodontic treatment. Gingivitis usually worsens during puberty as a result of hormonal changes. It is advised that brushing is supervised between ages 0-7 due to a lack of manual dexterity.
