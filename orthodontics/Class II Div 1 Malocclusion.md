## Relationships
* **Skeletal:** the mandible is in a retruded position in relation to the mid-facial skeleton (usually **moderate-severe** in division 1 malocclusions).
* **Incisor:** incisal edge of the lower incisor is **posterior** to the cingulum plateau of the upper incisor, and the upper incisors are **proclined**.
* **Canine:** the maxillary canine is positioned in front of the gap between the mandibular canine and first premolar.
* **Molar:** mesio-palatal cusp of the maxillary first molar occludes **anterior** to the mid-buccal groove of the mandibular first molar.

## Aetiology
* **Skeletal:** moderate-severe mandibular retrognathia
* **Dental:** proclined maxillary incisors
* **Soft tissue:** incompetent lips, lip trap, tongue thrust
* **Habits:** digit sucking

## Management
1. ***O*rthopaedic growth modification:** twin-block functional appliances, headgear.
2. ***O*rthodontic alignment:** fixed edgewise appliance.
3. ***O*rthognathic surgery:** if severe skeletal discrepancies, poor facial appearance and facial growth is complete.

Followed by long-term retention, usually with a passive removable appliance (Essix retainers).
