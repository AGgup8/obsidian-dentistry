## Relationships
* **Skeletal:** the mandible is in a retruded position in relation to the mid-facial skeleton (usually **mild** in division 2 malocclusions).
* **Incisor:** incisal edge of the lower incisor is **posterior** to the cingulum plateau of the upper incisor, and the upper incisors are **upright or retroclined**.
* **Canine:** the maxillary canine is positioned in front of the gap between the mandibular canine and first premolar.
* **Molar:** mesio-palatal cusp of the maxillary first molar occludes **anterior** to the mid-buccal groove of the mandibular first molar.

## Aetiology
* **Skeletal:** mild mandibular retrognathia, reduced vertical proportions
* **Dental:** upright or retroclined maxillary incisors, maxillary labial crowding, retrusive alveolar ridges
* **Soft tissue:** competent lips and a high lip line which rests on the cervical line of the upper incisors, retrusive lips

## Management
1. ***O*rthopaedic growth modification:** flat anterior bite plane, functional appliance (to reduce overbite).
2. ***O*rthodontic alignment:** extractions are usually avoided for division 2 malocclusions because it can cause retroclination of the labial segments which complicates overbite reduction, fixed edgewise appliance, proclination of the labial segments, and true incisor intrusion (to reduce overbite).
3. ***O*rthognathic surgery:** if severe skeletal discrepancies, poor facial appearance and facial growth is complete.

Followed by long-term retention, usually with a passive removable appliance (Essix retainers).
