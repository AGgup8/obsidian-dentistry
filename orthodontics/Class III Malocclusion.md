## Relationships
* **Skeletal:** the mandible is in a protruded position in relation to the mid-facial skeleton. Class III malocclusion are also associated with skeletal asymmetry (discrepancies in the transverse pattern).
* **Incisor:** incisal edge of the lower incisor is **anterior** to the cingulum plateau of the upper incisor.
* **Canine:** the maxillary canine is positioned in front of the gap between the mandibular canine and first premolar.
* **Molar:** mesio-palatal cusp of the maxillary first molar is **posterior** to the mid-buccal groove of the mandibular first molar.

## Aetiology
* **Genetic:** familial tendency
* **Skeletal:** maxillary retrusion and mandibular prognathism, mandibular prognathism often becomes more pronounced during adolescent growth.
* **Dental:** upright or retroclined maxillary incisors, crowding.
* **Soft tissue:** competent lips and a high lip line which rests on the cervical line of the upper incisors, retrusive lips.

## Management
The three O's:
1. ***O*rthopaedic growth modification:** reverse headgear if there is a skeletal discrepancy. 
2. ***O*rthodontic alignment:**
	* Extractions in the lower arch to retract the labial segment
	* Extractions in the upper arch due to crowding
	* Fixed edgewise appliance
3. ***O*rthognathic surgery:** if moderate-severe skeletal discrepancies, poor facial appearance and facial growth is complete. Class III malocclusions are prone to relapse if the patient has not stopped growing, because mandibular growth continues into adolescent growth.

Followed by long-term retention, usually with a passive removable appliance (Essex retainers).
