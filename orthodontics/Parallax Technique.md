The parallax technique uses a reference point (such as an adjacent tooth root) in relation to the object of interest (the impacted maxillary canine). The second image is taken following a tube shift. This allows the reference point and the object of interest can be re-examined. A comparison of the displacement of the object between the two radiographs can then be made using the reference point. If the object of interest has moved in the same direction as the tube shift, it is likely palatal, whereas movement in the opposite direction is likely buccal.

### Horizontal parallax
* Horizontal parallax requires a horizontal tube shift whilst keeping the vertical level the same.
* For example, two periapical radiographs or a periapical and anterior occlusal.

### Vertical parallax
* Vertical parallax requires a tube shift in a vertical direction.
* For example, orthopantomogram (8°) and a maxillary occlusal (60°) or orthopantomogram and a periapical radiograph.
