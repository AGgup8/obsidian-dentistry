## Lichen planus

**Demographic:** 4th-8th decade, women, Europeans

**History:** oral lichen planus lesions last from 4-25 years with a mean of 7 years

**Aetiology:** idiopathic, immunologically mediated process, may be related to stress, diet, diabetes, liver disease

**Symptoms:** Asymptomatic but may be painful when eating spicy or acidic foods. 

**Clinical features:** symmetrical, bilateral lesions on the buccal/labial mucosa, tongue and gingiva lesions. Keratotic variants are more common than ulcerative forms. 

**Morphological variants:** papular, reticular, plaque-like, erythematous/atrophic, erosive/ulcerative, bullous (violet-red colour)

**Differential diagnoses:** lichenoid reactions, leucoedema, dysplasia, leukoplakia, keratosis, DLE, GVHD, desquamative gingivitis

**Histology:** most characteristic feature is subepithelial band of inflammatory cells, basal cell liquefaction/degeneration

**Advice:** OHI, counselling if stress related, smoking cessation, awareness that lesions may develop outside the mouth

**Management:** non-curative, reduction of inflammation, reduction of pain, prevention of complications
* Asymptomatic - risk of malignant transformation (~1% over 10 year period), monitor lesions and attend the dentist regularly
* Symptomatic - eliminate sodium lauryl sulphate, eliminate dental trauma, reduce chemical irritation from acidic, spicy, strongly flavoured foods and beverages, reduce plaque accumulation, adjunct oral hygiene measures e.g. rinses
* Pharmaceutical: topical corticosteroids, topical calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus, pimecrolimus) - sparingly used due to associated malignancy risk

**Cutaneous Lichen Planus:** purple pruritic papules on flexor surfaces (Koebner phenomenon)., surface network of fine white "Wickham's striae" striations.

## Lichenoid reaction

**Aetiology:** drug or dental material induced (may have asymmetric distribution if due to reaction from local material)
Drugs: beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, diuretics, methyl dopa, oral hypoglycaemics, NSAID's, gold salts, penicillamine, antimalarials, allopurinol

**Diagnosis:** withdrawal of drug

**Clinical features:** often indistinguishable from lichen planus, more likely to be erosive and affect palate and tongue than lichen planus

**Histological:** similar to lichen planus, inflammatory infiltrate may be deeper and contain a larger number of plasma cells and eosinophils

**Management:** take drug history, consider patch testing, management as for lichen planus until it resolves (OHI, monitor lesions, attend dentist regularly)

## Systemic lupus erythematosus

Discoid lupus erythematosus
