## Aetiology
* **Crowding** is the main aetiological factor in buccal impactions.
* The **guidance theory** described by Becker et al., in 1981, suggests that the distal aspect of the lateral incisor is the guide for canine eruption. In his study, Becker found that palatally impacted canines were very closely associated with spaced dentitions and lateral incisors that are peg-shaped, of small mesiodistal width, or congenitally absent.
* The **genetic theory** described by Peck et al., 11 in 1994, considers the dental anomaly of impacted canines to be a product of polygenetic multifactorial inheritance. They based their theory on the fact that palatally displaced canines are concomitant with other dental anomalies, such as lateral premolar hypodontia and peg laterals, that they occur bilaterally and that there is a gender, familial and population difference in occurrence.

## Clinical assessment

**Visual inspection and palpation of the buccal sulcus for the canine bulge should commence at the age of eight years onwards.**

Impaction should be suspected when the maxillary canine is **not palpable in the buccal sulcus by the age of 10â€“11 years**. An asymmetric eruption pattern or inclination of adjacent teeth, especially the lateral incisor, suggests canine malposition.

#### Visual inspection
* Identify the **canine bulge** in the buccal sulcus between the roots of the lateral incisor and the first premolar.
* **Inclination of the lateral incisor** may indicate the type of impaction. Distal inclination may suggest palatal impaction, whereas a mesial inclination may suggest palatal impaction
* **Evaluate the colour of the deciduous canine and adjacent teeth.** Changes in colour may indicate root resorption and that the permanent canine is on track for eruption, or it may indicate previous trauma. A non-mobile canine with no colour changes may also suggest an impacted permanent canine. Colours changes in adjacent teeth may suggest pathological root resorption.

#### Palpation
* Palpate the buccal sulcus to identify the canine bulge.
* **Check the mobility** of deciduous canines and lateral incisors. Mobility may suggest root resorption from the impacted canine. 

## Radiographic assessment
* Radiographs should be taken when there is a noticeable difference in the eruption of the maxillary canines between the right and the left side, or where there is asymmetry on palpation.
* It may also be useful to take a radiograph in cases where there is delayed eruption of the lateral incisor or if there is a significant buccal proclination.

Radiographs using the **[[parallax technique]]** is an effective method of identifying the position of maxillary impacted canines. Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) scans can also be very useful in identification and localisation of an impacted maxillary canine, along with the presence/absence of **root resorption of adjacent teeth**. Lateral cephalograms can be useful to locate impacted canines and its relationship to other facial structures, but are typically only used when they are needed for further treatment planning.

## Complications
* Dentigerous cyst formation
* Ankylosis
* Internal resorption of the impacted canine
* External resorption of the adjacent (usually the incisors) or impacted tooth
* Displacement of adjacent teeth and loss of arch length

## Management
* Early detection of impacted maxillary canines is key in helping to achieve good outcomes.
* Frequent check-up appointments allow general dental practitioners to be well-placed to quickly identify an impacted maxillary canine.
* If impaction is identified, an orthodontic opinion should be sought to gain advice.

## Treatment
* Impacted canines may be left in-situ. This is usually if the patient is happy or declines treatment. If this is the case, review bi-annually and warn the patient of potential complications.
* **Interceptive treatment:** the **deciduous canine is extracted** to allow for spontaneous eruption of the permanent successor.
* **Surgical exposure and orthodontic alignment:** when interceptive treatment has failed, a **surgical exposure and orthodontic alignment** of the impacted canine may be the treatment of choice in certain cases. **The NICE guidelines favour expose and bone.**
* **Surgical removal:** consider surgical removal if the tooth is poorly positioned, has a curved root, or extraction is needed as part of the whole orthodontic treatment plan.
* **Transplantation** of the tooth may be considered if interceptive treatment has failed and the tooth is in a very poor position. But this is usually if there are no other possible treatment options (if treatment has failed or is deemed inappropriate).
