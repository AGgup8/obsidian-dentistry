Dental trauma refers to any injury or damage to the teeth, gums, or surrounding tissues in the mouth. Dental trauma can result from a variety of causes, such as accidents, sports injuries, falls, or violence. Prompt and appropriate treatment is essential to minimize the long-term effects of dental trauma and restore oral health and function.

## Risk factors
The most common teeth affected by dental trauma are the **maxillary central incisors**.
* Male
* Ages 2-6
* Overjet >6 mm
* Low socioeconomic status

## Further investigations
* **Sensibility testing:** Sensibility testing can be unreliable after trauma
* **Tooth colour:** Yellow, pink or grey discolouration
* **Tooth mobility:** Grade 1 to 3 mobility, ankylosis
* **Percussion sound:** Normal or dull
* **Tender to percussion:** +ve TTP might suggest periapical pathology
* **Radiographic:** Periapical radiolucency, closed or open apex

## Types of trauma
The severity of dental trauma can vary widely, ranging from minor chips or cracks in the teeth to more serious injuries that may require extensive treatment, such as root canal therapy or tooth extraction.

### Fractures
Crown
Root

### Periodontal
[[Concussion]]
[[Subluxation]]
[[Extrusion Luxation]]
[[Lateral luxation]]
[[Intrusion luxation]]
[[Avulsion]]

### Oral mucosa
Laceration
Contusion
Abrasion

## Sequelae

### Pulp
The survival of the pulp after trauma is influenced by the **severity of damage to the blood supply**, **area and time of exposure** and **stage of root development**.

The 5 sequelae for the pulp following trauma are: health, [[Pulp Canal Obliteration]], [[Internal Inflammatory Resorption]], [[Internal Replacement Resorption]], and [[Pulp Necrosis]].

### Periodontal
Periodontal tissues will undergo normal healing or [[External Resorption]].

### Gingival
Gingival tissues will undergo normal healing, or loss of attached gingivae.

### Root development
The root will follow continuous, disrupted or arrested growth.
