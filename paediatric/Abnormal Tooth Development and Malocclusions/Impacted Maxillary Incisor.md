## Definition
Delayed eruption of the permanent maxillary incisor teeth can be considered in the following circumstances:
* eruption of the contralateral incisor occurred >6 months earlier;
* the maxillary incisors remain unerupted >1 year after the eruption of the mandibular incisors; and 
* there is significant deviation from the normal eruption sequence

## Clinical assessment
* Identify any primary teeth retained significantly beyond their normal exfoliation dates.
* Record spacing, rotations and displacement of permanent teeth in the upper incisor region.
* Space loss due to drift of the adjacent lateral incisor into the central incisor position may suggest a disturbance in normal dental development.
* The presence of labial or palatal swellings may indicate the site of an unerupted incisor.

## Radiographic assessment
Radiographs should be taken when:
* there is **failure of eruption associated with one or more permanent maxillary teeth**
* or **retention of the primary incisors beyond the normal age-range**

Periapical views and upper standard occlusal radiographs can facilitate the the use of [[Parallax Technique|parallax]] to localise the bucco-lingual position of the tooth.

Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) scans can also be very useful in identification and localisation of an impacted maxillary canine, along with the presence/absence of **root resorption of adjacent teeth**.

Lateral cephalograms can be useful to locate and assess impacted incisors, particularly the height of impact and bucco-lingual inclination of the crown and root of the tooth, but are typically only used when they are needed for further treatment planning.

## Management
The general principles of management include the **provision of adequate space** in the dental arch and **removal of any obstruction to eruption**. Eruption can be promoted through surgical exposure, with or without orthodontic alignment.

#### 1. Removal of the obstruction with or without space creation
The removal of obstructions such as supernumerary teeth or odontomes can facilitate the spontaneous eruption of permanent maxillary incisors. Spontaneous eruption is more likely if space exists in the dental arch to accommodate the unerupted incisor.

#### 2. Surgical intervention
**Open exposure** of an unerupted permanent maxillary incisor is carried out by a simple elliptical incision of the overlying soft tissue. **It is only indicated if the tooth is very superficial beneath the mucosa and a band of attached gingiva can be retained after exposure**. A band of gingiva is required so that the gingiva can form a healthy gingival attachment to the tooth when it is in its final position.

**Closed exposure** is preferred, especially when the unerupted permanent maxillary incisor is **high**. In the closed technique, a mucoperiosteal flap is raised, and an attachment is bonded to the impacted incisor.

#### 3. Incisor Removal
Removal of the permanent maxillary incisor is considered when the tooth has significant dilaceration, ankylosis or infra-occlusion. Typically, space is maintained for a subsequent fixed or removable prosthesis.

### Complications of treatment
* Failure of treatment
* Ankylosis
* External root resorption
* Poor gingival aesthetics
