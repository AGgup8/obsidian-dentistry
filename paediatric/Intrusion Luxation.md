The tooth has been intruded/displaced partially into the socket.

## Primary teeth
1. Take baseline periapical or occlusal baseline radiograph.  When the apex is displaced toward or through the labial bone plate, the apical tip can be seen and the image of the tooth will appear shorter (foreshortened) than the contralateral tooth. When the apex is displaced toward the permanent tooth germ, the apical tip cannot be visualized and the image of the tooth will appear elongated.
2. **Do not position the tooth because it can affect the development or eruption of the permanent successor.** The tooth may spontaneously reposition itself within 6 mo - 1 yr.
3. Follow up at 1 wk, 6-8 wk, 6 mo and 1 yr.
4. Parents should be informed to watch for any unfavourable outcomes and return to the clinic if necessary.
	Unfavourable outcomes: symptomatic, pulp necrosis and infection, ankylosis, no further root development, no improvement in position, negative impact on the development or eruption of permanent successor.
