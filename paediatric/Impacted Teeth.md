An impacted tooth is a tooth that has **failed to erupt** due to an identifiable obstruction / barrier to eruption of a normally positioned tooth.

The most likely to be impacted are: third molars > maxillary canines > maxillary central incisors.

## Aetiology
**Local factors:**
* Early extraction or loss of primary teeth  
* Prolonged retention of primary teeth  
* Crowding  
* Trauma

**Localised pathology:**
* Supernumerary teeth  
* Ankylosis  
* Odontomes  
* Cysts

## Complications
* Internal resorption of impacted tooth  
* External resorption of impacted or adjacent tooth  
* Displacement of adjacent teeth and loss of arch length
* Ankylosis
* Cyst formation
