Complete displacement of the tooth out of the socket.

## Primary Teeth
1. Take baseline periapical or occlusal baseline radiograph. It is essential where the primary tooth is not brought into the clinic to **ensure that the missing tooth has not been intruded**. The radiograph will also provide a baseline for **assessment of the developing permanent tooth** and to determine whether it has been displaced.
2. **Avulsed primary teeth should not be replanted**. Reasons include a significant treatment burden (including replantation, splint placement and removal, root canal treatment) for a young child and potentially damage the permanent tooth or its eruption. The most important reason not to replant is to avoid the risk of the child aspirating the tooth, which could lead to a medical emergency.
3. Follow up at 6-8 wk. **Further follow up at 6 yr of age is indicated to monitor eruption of the permanent tooth.**
4. Parents should be informed to watch for any unfavourable outcomes and return to the clinic if necessary. 
	Unfavourable outcomes: negative impact on the development or eruption of permanent successor.
