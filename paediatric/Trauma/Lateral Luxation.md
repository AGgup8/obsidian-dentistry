The tooth has been displaced non-axially. Lateral luxation can cause fracture of the alveolar bone.

## Primary teeth
1. Take baseline periapical or occlusal baseline radiograph. There will be **increased periodontal ligament space apically**.
2. If there is minimal displacement, do not reposition or treat the tooth because the tooth may spontaneously reposition within 6 mo. If there is severe displacement, XLA or gently reposition tooth and splint for **4 wk using a flexible splint**.
3. Follow up at 1 wk, 4 wk for splint removal, 6-8 wk, 6 mo and 1 yr.
4. Parents should be informed to watch for any unfavourable outcomes and return to the clinic if necessary.
	Unfavourable outcomes: symptomatic, pulp necrosis and infection, ankylosis, no further root development, no improvement in position, negative impact on the development or eruption of permanent successor.
