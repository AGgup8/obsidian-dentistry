## Initial Assessment
Elicit a careful medical, social (including those who attend with the child), dental, and accident history. Thoroughly examine the head and neck and intra-orally for both bony and soft tissue injuries. Be alert to concomitant injuries including head injury, facial fractures, missing tooth fragments, or lacerations.

## Intentional (non-accidental) injuries
Dental and facial trauma can occur in cases of intentional injuries. Clinicians should check whether the history of the accident and the injuries sustained are consistent or match. In situations where there is suspicion of abuse, prompt referral for a full physical examination and investigation of the incident should be arranged.

## Soft Tissue Injuries
3 The lips, oral mucosa, attached and free gingivae, and the frenula should be checked for lacerations and haematomas. The lips should be examined for possible embedded tooth fragments.

## Further Investigations
The use of extra-oral and intra-oral photographs is recommended, but **pulp sensibility tests are not reliable in primary teeth**. **Tooth mobility**, **colour**, **tenderness to manual pressure**, and the **position or displacement** should be recorded. 

The colour of injured and uninjured teeth should be recorded at each clinic visit. Discolouration is a common complication following luxation injuries. This discolouration may fade, and the tooth may regain its original shade over a period of weeks or months. Teeth with persistent dark discolouration have a non-vital pulp. **Root canal treatment is not indicated for discoloured teeth unless there are clinical or radiographic signs of infection of the root canal system.** Radiographs should be used sparingly to minimize a child's exposure to radiation. Clinicians should question each radiograph they take and ask whether additional radiographs will positively affect the diagnosis or treatment provided for the child.

## Management
In general, there is limited evidence to support many of the treatment options in the primary dentition. **Observation is often the most appropriate option in the emergency situation unless there is risk of aspiration, ingestion, or interference with the occlusion.**

* **Reassure the child and parents.** Provision of dental treatment depends on the child's maturity, ability to cope and cooperation.
* Advise a **soft diet**, **immaculate oral hygiene** and taking care with eating to not further traumatise the injured tooth.
* **Clean the affected area with a cotton swab combined with chlorhexidine mouthwash** to prevent plaque accumulation and promote gingival healing.
* Advise pain relief with **analgesics**.
* Splinting is used for alveolar bone fractures and occasionally may be needed in cases of root fractures and lateral luxations.

### Avulsed primary teeth
**An [[Avulsion|avulsed]] primary tooth should not be replanted.** Reasons include a significant treatment burden (including replantation, splint placement and removal, root canal treatment) for a young child and potentially damage the permanent tooth or its eruption. The most important reason not to replant is to avoid the risk of the child aspirating the tooth, which could lead to a medical emergency. **Careful follow up is required to monitor the development and eruption of the permanent tooth.**
